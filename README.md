# Research

### :wave: Welcome to the repo for FAC22's research! :zap:

### :sparkles: Please upload the notes from your tech spikes here: :sparkles:

Upload your notes in the folder corresponding to the current week. If there **is no folder** for your current week, you are the first one to upload a file and have honour of making it! :tada:
   
   If your presentation was made using HackMD, you can copy and paste the markdown straight into the new file, otherwise drop a link for others to follow (Google Slides, Canva, etc)

##### How do I make a new folder?

1. Click the `Create new file` button on top of the repo

2. Include the week number in the filepath on top of the new file (make sure to type `week#/[your research topic].md`)

   ![filepath](https://github.com/fac-15/Research/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-30%20at%2019.43.53.png)

3. Click `Commit changes` at the bottom - no need to fill in any commit messages or wait for approval

##### What happens if I don't upload my research?

**You will prompted on Discord for all eternity to do so**

**Be smart - upload on the day you write and present it!**
